These options feature beautiful West African print fabrics which give a more firm shape to the face than the soft cotton Ankara option.

Similar to our Ankara masks this mask design features a snug fit around the face to shape for a perfect fit. There is an internal pocket which allows for filter paper to be inserted inside for another layer of protection.
These masks all have a black interior lining with a silky feel that is great against the skin to wear everyday and luxury comfort. 

These masks include usage instruction but can be machine washed on low heat to be used multiple times for reusable sustainable safety

PRODUCT INFO

These masks are made to a standard size but it is possible for me to slightly adjust masks to make them slightly large or smaller on request. These masks come with adjusable straps to allow users to have maximum comfortability. 

size: Width (ear to ear) 20 cm // 7.9""
Height (nose to chin) 13 cm // 5.1""
